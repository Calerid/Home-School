# 📚 Home-School

Welcome to Home-School! This application allows parents to record and track their child's homeschooling progress. Parents can add courses and lessons, and both parents and children can log progress along the way. 🎓

### 🚧 Work In Progress: 
I am actively developing new features to make tracking easier and more effective for homeschooling families!

## 🌟 Planned Features
🏡 **Household Management**: Add multiple children to your household and keep track of each one's progress individually.

📋 **Course Management**: Add courses for each child, including subjects like Math, Science, and History.

📚 **Lesson Management**: Organize courses into lessons and keep track of what has been completed.

⏱️ **Time Tracking**: Define the required hours for each course and track the time spent on each lesson.

📎 **Attach Documents**: Attach homework, projects, and reference documents to any lesson.

📝 **Notes**: Add notes to each lesson for additional context or reflections.

📊 **Progress Graphing**: Visualize progress toward end-of-year goals, with optional grading.

📄 **Year-End Reports**: Generate a detailed PDF or XML report documenting the entire year's progress.

Please note that compliance with your local government is ultimately your responsibility. While this tool has the intention of making that easier - I am not aiming it at meeting any specific regulatory requirements. Having physical documents as a backup is always the best option :)
